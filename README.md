# pySerial-Monitor
A simple Serial Monitor that I wrote in python.
I used the curses module and I tested in Linux.
It is pretty modifiable I made it having in mind my own AVR projects. I basically wanted a simple way to communicate with an AVR device through a serial port.
Once you run it you can press ENTER and enter any text to send through the port and press enter again.
